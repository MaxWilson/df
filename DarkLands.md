Dark Lands: a sword-and-sorcerer campaign. Town ("Urik") is a city-state dominated (economically and legally) by corrupt templar-priests of the Sorcerer-King. The templars play up the danger of the badlands outside the city in order to keep citizens reliant on them for food (grown via magically-enhanced agriculture) and products of industry. Other towns exist but the setting overall is bleak except where players intervene.

Templars tend to resent compassionate, selfless, charitable people such as clerics in the same way the Israelite kings and clergy resented prophets: a cleric who pays the appropriate bribes to free a falsely-imprisoned freeman (or noble!) gains a friend for life, but the templar who had him imprisoned in order to confiscate his distillery may resent being made to feel like a bad guy and become the cleric's enemy!

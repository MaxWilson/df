In some ways, Swashbuckler is kind of redundant once you have a good Martial Artist online with striking ST 17, 
weapon-master (knife), Extra Attack, Luck, and Combat Reflexes online. That's 20 + 25 + 15 + 15 = 75 points of
progression along, and you don't get to use fencing parries with your Knife skill, but still... you also don't
wind up "wasting" any points in rapier when your real goal is to be a ranged combat specialist with strong
close-combat capacity. You also have better defenses against spells than a Swashbuckler does.

So instead of a half-ogre swashbuckler, it might make sense to have a half-ogre throwing master instead rather
than in addition to. Then you could have a knight or scout ON TOP of that. That leads a party configuration like

Half-ogre knight with high Sacrificial Parry
Half-ogre martial artist (Throwing Art 20, Mantis Strike)
Druid with PI 6, ER 3, Traps, Tactics, Create Animal-20
Fit cleric
Fit wealthy elven bard with BT 3, Song of Humiliation and ER 2
Wizard with Concussion, Phantom, Initiative, Wizard Eye, Dark Vision-20

A high-DR knight is worse against unknown threats (harder to run away) but better against traps 
(which often cannot be Dodged reliably and almost never parried). He's good at protecting others from
monsters. Not terrible at ranged combat either (can get Weapon Master on Sling; could also use a 
strong bow with bodkin points, though not as fast as a scout).

Maybe something like:

Knight, half-ogre [20], Striking ST +1 [5], Weapon master (All) [45]
Sacrificial Parry [1], Shield Wall Training [1], Polearm-21, Shield [1], Night Vision +2,
Fast-Draw (Stone), Fast-Draw (Knife), Sling-14
In this way we are basically trading Extra Attack for a broader Weapon Master that can be used
with slings too, maybe eventually bows.

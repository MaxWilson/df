Scout or Throwing Art martial artist  
Scout is better with traps and at extreme range--is this important?  
Half-ogre martial artist with boomerangs has higher encumbrance and is better against homogenous creatures with high DR like puddings--is this important? 
Elven scout has easier access to Mage scrolls
Kiai works against almost anything
Martial Artist has better access to weird abilities like wall-climbing, regeneration. Might make a good independent character.
Martial Artist throwing random stuff is cheaper than arrows. But arrows are cheaper than boomerangs, and can be enhanced with bodkin points (useless against homogenous though) or cutting points (pretty decent against anything).
Scout can use oversized longbows.
Martial Artist can be faster in a sprint.
Scout gets peripheral vision, danger sense, Move +6.
Four arrows in the time it takes to ready and throw one boomerang. Four daggers can also be thrown in that time. Four arrows with a ST 11 bow is 1d+2 initially, 1d+4 once Weapon Master (bow) comes online. Four daggers is 1d natively, 1d+2 with Throwing Art.
Martial Artist can have Knife-18 and Weapon Master (Knife) for close combat, giving good close-combat parries (12+DB) for 3d-2 cut with a large knife (3d+4 with Weapon Master). Not bad for a secondary strategy.
Fast-draw (star-shuriken) might be possible, for th-1 cut damage. Nice and lightweight, comparable in cost and weight to arrows.
Thrown weapons like hatchets and shuriken are shield-compatible.
Elven Scout has better Perception than Half-ogre martial artist, may be less likely to be surprised.
I think either of them could do fine.
